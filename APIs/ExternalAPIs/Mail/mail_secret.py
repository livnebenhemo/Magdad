GMAIL_USER = 'TalpiXSystem@gmail.com'
GMAIL_PASSWORD = 'TalpiX2022!'

############## If this doesn't work (login failed or whatever), it might be because the password changed. But more likely, its because gmail automatically turns
# off 'allow less secure apps' when its not frequently used. So before you try to change the password, first try to log in on google, go to account, security
# allow secure apps, and turn it on.
